## Run the project locally

### 1. Install global dependencies

The project requires Node.js and Brunch, so make sure you have both.

```bash
brew install node
```

```bash
npm install -g brunch
```

### 2. Install project dependencies

From the cloned project directory, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Build app

If you want to build the app once, run:

```bash
brunch build
```

If you want to build the app whenever files change, run:

```bash
brunch watch
```

### 4. Serve app locally

You can serve the app with the `--server` flag to `brunch watch`. When run, the
app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3333`.

```bash
brunch watch --server
```
